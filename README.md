To-do list:
- [ ] getting actual data from the network and caching it
- [ ] interface improvements (adding icons for equipment) -> but it's better to completely redo it - designer's work :)
- [ ] animations - appearance of tiles and filling of equipment counters
- [ ] make a day change by swiping left-right on the information screen
- [ ] make support for different screen orientations on different devices (iPhone, iPad)
- [ ] make support for Apple TV and Apple Watch
- [ ] add localization for different languages
- [ ] make data display using graphs and tables
